A selection of map markers, icons and style files.

## Background
In 2014, a set of 'disaster' event icons were created for RemotePixel's [DisasterWatch](https://disasterwatch.remotepixel.ca/) project. These were then requested for use on NASA's [WorldView](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/) project. After undergoing some refinement and expansion, these icons are now released here for public usage in any GIS / mapping project.
